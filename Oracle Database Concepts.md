# Oracle Database Concepts README

## Sequence Object
In Oracle, a sequence is a database object used to generate unique numerical values, typically employed to provide a unique identifier for rows in a table.

## Procedural SQL
Procedural SQL enables the usage and storage of procedural SQL language within a database. It allows for the encapsulation of complex logic within the database, enhancing performance and simplifying application development.

## Anonymous PL/SQL Block
An anonymous PL/SQL block is a sequence of PL/SQL statements without a name, often used for one-time execution tasks or ad-hoc scripting.

## Trigger
A trigger in Oracle is a procedural code that automatically executes in response to certain events on a particular table or view, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations. Triggers are used for enforcing data integrity constraints, auditing changes to data, and automatically updating related data. There are two types of triggers: row-level triggers and statement-level triggers.

## Stored Procedure
A stored procedure is a precompiled and reusable set of SQL statements and procedural logic stored in the database. Advantages include improved performance, reduced network traffic, enhanced security, and encapsulation of complex business logic.

## Cursor
A cursor is a database object used to retrieve and manipulate data row by row. There are two types of cursors: implicit and explicit. Implicit cursors are automatically created by the database management system, while explicit cursors are explicitly declared by the programmer.

## Stored Function
A stored function is a subroutine stored in the database that returns a single value. Stored functions can be invoked within SQL statements or PL/SQL code.

## Embedded SQL and Host Language
Embedded SQL refers to SQL statements written within a host programming language, allowing seamless integration of database operations into application code. The host language is the programming language within which SQL statements are embedded.

## Static SQL and Dynamic SQL
Static SQL refers to SQL statements that are hard-coded into a program at compile time and do not change during program execution. Dynamic SQL refers to SQL statements that are constructed and executed dynamically at runtime, providing flexibility in query construction and execution.
