# Database Design README

## Overview
This README provides a brief overview of database design concepts and practices, focusing on relational databases. It covers fundamental concepts, such as relational schema, primary keys, foreign keys, integrity constraints, and entity-relationship (ER) modeling.

## Relational Schema
A relational schema is a logical database model that defines the structure of the database without considering the physical implementation details. It describes the tables, columns, and relationships between them.

## Contemporary Commercial Relational DBMS Packages
Some of the contemporary commercial relational database management system (DBMS) packages include:
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server
- IBM Db2
- Google Cloud SQL

## Relational Database Concepts
- **Relational Database**: A database modeled using the relational database model.
- **Relation**: Also known as a table in the context of relational databases.
- **Tuple**: A row in a relation (table).

## Primary Key
A primary key is a column or set of columns whose values uniquely identify each row in a table. For example, "EmployeeID" in the "Employee" table can be a primary key.

## Composite Primary Key
A composite primary key is a primary key composed of multiple attributes. For instance, "OrderID" and "CustomerID" in the "Order" table can form a composite primary key.

## Entity Integrity Constraint
An entity integrity constraint ensures that all primary key columns in a table have unique values.

## Foreign Key
A foreign key is a column in a table that establishes a relationship with a primary key column in another table. For example, "CustomerID" in the "Order" table can be a foreign key referring to the "CustomerID" column in the "Customers" table.

## Referential Integrity Constraint
Referential integrity constraint ensures that values in foreign key columns are valid references to existing primary key values.

## ER Modeling
ER modeling is a process of designing a database schema using entity-relationship diagrams to represent entities, attributes, and relationships between them.

## Implicit and User-Defined Constraints
- **Implicit Constraints**: Relational database model rules that must be satisfied for a valid database. Examples include physical constraints and time constraints.
- **User-Defined Constraints**: Restrictions specified by users or stakeholders, such as budget constraints or regulatory constraints.

## Database Design Best Practices
ER modeling is a crucial step before creating a relational schema or implementing a database. It promotes clarity, completeness, flexibility, normalization, and documentation, leading to a robust database solution. Skipping ER modeling can result in misunderstandings, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies in the database design and implementation process.
